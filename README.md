A **static‚Äësite** showcase of an e‚Äëcommerce recommendation system that illustrates the core ideas behind collaborative filtering, performance evaluation, and data visualisation. All logic is simulated with vanilla JavaScript, so the project can be run locally or hosted for free on GitHub‚ÄØPages.

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Project Overview  

The **E‚ÄëCommerce Recommendation System** demo is built as a single‚Äëpage application (SPA) that mimics the behaviour of a real‚Äëworld product recommender:

| Aspect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Data** | A small, hard‚Äëcoded dataset representing users, items, and ratings. |
| **Algorithms** | <ul><li>**User‚ÄëBased Collaborative Filtering** ‚Äì finds similar users based on rating vectors.</li><li>**Item‚ÄëBased Collaborative Filtering** ‚Äì finds similar items based on co‚Äërating patterns.</li></ul> |
| **Recommendation Output** | For a selected user, the UI shows a list of 5 suggested products with a confidence score (0‚Äë1). |
| **Metrics Dashboard** | Displays precision, recall, F1‚Äëscore, accuracy, MAE, and RMSE calculated on the simulated test set. |
| **Visualisations** | Chart.js line and bar charts illustrate metric trends and recommendation coverage over time. |
| **Responsiveness** | Layout adapts fluidly from 320‚ÄØpx (mobile) to 1440‚ÄØpx (desktop). |

All heavy lifting (matrix operations, similarity calculations, metric formulas) is performed client‚Äëside using vanilla JavaScript, making the repo **framework‚Äëfree** and ideal for learning purposes.

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Features  

| ‚úÖ | Feature | Detail |
|---|--------|--------|
| 1 | **Interactive Dashboard** | Real‚Äëtime charts react to user selections (e.g., switching between user‚Äëbased vs. item‚Äëbased). |
| 2 | **Sample Recommendations** | Each recommendation card shows product image, name, price, and a confidence bar. |
| 3 | **Performance Metrics** | Precision, recall, F1‚Äëscore, accuracy, MAE, RMSE are displayed numerically and plotted. |
| 4 | **Data Visualisation** | <ul><li>**Metric Trend** ‚Äì line chart of accuracy over simulated epochs.</li><li>**Coverage** ‚Äì stacked bar chart of recommended vs. non‚Äërecommended items.</li></ul> |
| 5 | **Responsive Design** | CSS Grid & Flexbox ensure optimal layout on all device sizes. |
| 6 | **Clean Code Structure** | All source files are human‚Äëreadable; functions are modular with comments. |
| 7 | **No Build Tools** | Simply open `index.html` ‚Äì no npm, webpack, or server required. |
| 8 | **GitHub Pages Ready** | Deploy in one click; the repo includes a ready‚Äëto‚Äëpublish `README.md`. |

* **Data Layer** ‚Äì a static JSON object embedded in the HTML defines users, products, and rating scores.  
* **Algorithm Layer** ‚Äì functions compute **cosine similarity** between vectors, select the **k‚Äënearest neighbours**, and aggregate neighbour ratings to produce confidence scores.  
* **Presentation Layer** ‚Äì the DOM is updated via `document.createElement`/`innerHTML`. Chart.js receives metric arrays to plot dynamic graphs.

*All JavaScript and CSS are embedded in `index.html` to keep the repository minimal. If you prefer external files, you can create `script.js` and `style.css` and reference them from the HTML.*

## 7Ô∏è‚É£ Getting Started  

### 7.1 Prerequisites  

| Requirement | Why |
|-------------|-----|
| Modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge) | Supports ES6 modules, `fetch`, and CSS Grid. |
| Git (optional) | Clone the repo or push changes. |
| GitHub account (optional) | For deployment and collaboration. |

### 7.2 Clone & Run Locally  

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ecommerce-recommendation-system.git

# Enter the directory
cd ecommerce-recommendation-system

# Open the page (macOS / Linux / Windows)
# macOS
open index.html
# Linux
xdg-open index.html
# Windows
start index.html
```

You should see the dashboard with default user recommendations and metric charts. No server or npm install is required.

### 7.3 Exploring the Code  

| Section | File/Location | What to Look For |
|--------|----------------|-----------------|
| Data definition | `index.html ‚Üí <script>` | `const dataset = {...}` ‚Äì users, items, ratings. |
| Similarity function | `function cosineSimilarity(a, b)` | Uses dot product / magnitude formula. |
| Recommendation engine | `function getRecommendations(userId, type)` | `type` = `'user'` or `'item'`. |
| Metric calculations | `function computeMetrics(predictions, groundTruth)` | Returns an object with accuracy, precision, etc. |
| Chart rendering | `new Chart(ctx, config)` | Adjust `labels` or `datasets` to experiment. |

Feel free to modify the dataset or the `k` (neighbour count) to see how metrics change in real time.

## 8Ô∏è‚É£ Deployment Guide (GitHub‚ÄØPages)  

1. **Create a New Repository**  
   - Go to GitHub ‚Üí **New repository** ‚Üí name it `ecommerce-recommendation-system`.  
   - Initialise with a README (you can replace it later).  

2. **Push Local Code**  

   ```bash
   git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/ecommerce-recommendation-system.git
   git branch -M main
   git push -u origin main
   ```

3. **Enable GitHub Pages**  
   - Navigate to **Settings ‚Üí Pages** (or simply click the ‚ÄúPages‚Äù tab).  
   - Under **Source**, select **Branch: main** and **Folder: / (root)**.  
   - Click **Save**. GitHub will generate a URL like:  

     ```
     https://yourusername.github.io/ecommerce-recommendation-system/
     ```

4. **Verify**  
   Open the URL in a browser. The demo should load exactly as it does locally.

5. **Custom Domain (Optional)**  
   - Add a `CNAME` file in the repository root containing your domain (e.g., `www.myshop.com`).  
   - Configure DNS A‚Äërecords to point to GitHub Pages IPs (see GitHub docs).

## 9Ô∏è‚É£ Performance Metrics Explained  

| Metric | Formula | Interpretation |
|--------|---------|----------------|
| **Accuracy** | `(TP + TN) / (TP + TN + FP + FN)` | Overall proportion of correct predictions. |
| **Precision** | `TP / (TP + FP)` | How many recommended items were actually relevant. |
| **Recall** | `TP / (TP + FN)` | How well the system captures all relevant items. |
| **F1‚ÄëScore** | `2 * (Precision * Recall) / (Precision + Recall)` | Harmonic mean of precision and recall ‚Äì balances both. |
| **MAE (Mean Absolute Error)** | ` (1/n) Œ£ |yÃÇ_i - y_i| ` | Average absolute deviation between predicted scores and true ratings. |
| **RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)** | ` ‚àö[(1/n) Œ£ (yÃÇ_i - y_i)¬≤] ` | Penalises larger errors more heavily than MAE. |

*Values shown in the README table (e.g., Accuracy‚ÄØ85‚ÄØ%) are derived from the **simulated test set** included in the code. They serve as a baseline for educational comparison.*
